# Mid Meal Reporting Web app

## Project Description

The MM Reporting Web Project is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the management and reporting of Mid-Day Meal in schools. The project includes two main panels: the admin Panel and the School Panel. Each panel provides specific functionalities tailored to the needs of administrators and school officials, respectively.

### Features

#### Admin Panel
- View Registered Schools: Administrators can view a list of all registered schools, including detailed reports of each school's daily entries and previous months' bills.
- Search Schools: Schools can be searched by their registered mobile numbers for quick access.
- Weekly Menu Management: Administrators can create and modify weekly menus specifying the value of each item per student per day. The menu is categorized by class type (Primary: I-V and Middle: VI-VIII) and by day (Mon/Thu, Tue/Wed, Fri/Sat).

#### School Panel
- School Registration: Schools can register using their mobile numbers. Post-registration, they need to complete their profiles with necessary information, such as the total number of students, school type (Primary/Middle), PAN, AADHAR, UDI number, and school medium (Hindi/Urdu).
- Daily Entry Registers: Based on their profile information, schools can load primary and middle class registers and make daily entries.
- Bill Generation: Schools can generate total bills for the running month based on their register entry data. These bills can be downloaded and printed.
- Monthly Bill Management: At the end of each month, the final bill is automatically generated, saved, and made available in the bills tab along with all previous months' bills.

### Objective

The MM Reporting Web Project aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly platform for managing and reporting MDM program data. By integrating detailed reporting, easy search functionalities, and automated bill generation, the project enhances transparency, accuracy, and ease of use for both administrators and schools.
